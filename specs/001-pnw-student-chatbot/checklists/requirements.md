- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria (excluding items pending clarification)
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The three [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (FR-024, FR-025, FR-026) were resolved via `/speckit-clarify` on 2026-09-16: open access with a disclaimer (no SSO), a standalone web page as the primary surface, and running alongside Leo as a separate tool. See the Clarifications section in spec.md.
- All checklist items pass.
